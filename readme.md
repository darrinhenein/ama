I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means _anything_ - Personal questions. Work. Life. Design. Code. Video Games and Game Development. Whatever.

I am the Design Lead for Firefox Mobile at Mozilla. I design, write, [make video games](http://lastronautgame.com) and love to read. I'm also a father and husband.

I'm [@darrinhenein](http://twitter.com/darrinhenein) on twitter, I write at [darrinhenein.com](http://www.darrinhenein.com).
